# ClimbCollector

This is a supplementary app for collecting rock climbing route data to be used for creating the database for Vetical Climbing navigation app.

This is a work in progress and will be updated periodically.

At this stage, upon activation, it automatically starts collecting Location data (Latitude, Longitude, and Altitude), and add it to the SQLite databse. It also has an activity to show the location data on map.
